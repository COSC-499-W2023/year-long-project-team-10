# if you dont know how to get your own keys below are the steps:
# 1) head to https://ubc-cicsso.awsapps.com/start#/
# 2) enter your provisioned username from the client
# 3) enter your password
# 4) enter the code given in the MFA app
# 5) click on your AWS account and click the dropdown
# 6) click command line or programatic access scroll all the way down to get your own keys and put them here

# if it is your first time ever logging into AWS as per steps 1-3, then your account is not activated yet, and your invitation has expired (not to worry happens to the best of us)
# you will have to email the client (scott) and ask him to send you a new invitation link where you will follow its instructions to set up your account
# if you are indeed smarter than me (which you probably are) please find a way in which we dont have to keep changing these keys every 2 seconds because they are short term!
# thanks and much love!
# ps. we cannot create IAM roles to solve this issue, our account types dont allow us to.
