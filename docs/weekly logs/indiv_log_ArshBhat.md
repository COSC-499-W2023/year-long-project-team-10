**Week**: 17
**Week**: `29-01-2024` - `04-02-2024`
**GitHub Account**: `ArshBhat`

## Individual Objectives
- Code option for user to screen record videos to upload
  - Create a new window with a preview screen for users to see themselves while recording
  - Code ability to record audio as well
  - Fix audio drop issues
  - Style Start/Stop buttons and adjust page layout due to them
- Research on object detection and blurring
  My Research began with understanding how blurring works on a deeper level. I read about face detection using the OpenCV library and got a browser environment code for detecting faces in video capture. However, when I tried implementing the same strategy into my Node.js environment, it was incompatible with the latest version. I also read that the same code could only process 1 image at a time and not a continuous video on my laptop. I read about more and more algorithms and understood that performing face detection locally is simply too time-consuming. Hence, I switched to a third-party API-based method, Amazon Rekognition. I researched more and understood that I had to send this video file as an S3 bucket. After that, we will use a lambda function and recognize faces. I will be implementing that this week.

## Individual Objectives
- Fix issues with the Upload Video window
  - Fix issues with node_modules and running js
  - Fix audio drop issues
- Incorporate front-end Upload Video code with backend S3 file storage (Ahmed's code)
- Research on object detection and blurring
  I began with researching on s3 and lambda functions. I was able to configure AWS on my laptop. I practice creating S3 buckets via terminal and sending files to those buckets. I further researched setting up Lambda function triggers so that the moment a file arrives in my AWS S3 bucket, it automatically triggers object detection. I will be implementing it this week.
