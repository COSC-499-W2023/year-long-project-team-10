Reasoning for the Aesthetic Redegin of the Chat's Page:
- Previously, the chats page was designed with the intention of showing the functionality of our feature rather than then complete product. This page lacked many critical features such as a responsive design which would work at both a desktop and mobile screen size. The new design takes these and other design factors into consideration and significantly improved the look and feel of the website. This not only provides a better look website but also improve user - website interaction.

**Estabilishing functionality to update Components Dyamically**:
Please see issues [#150](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-10/issues/150) & [#158](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-10/issues/158) for more information and specific tasks. Effective session management has been one of our key goals since the start of this project. So much of the functionality in our website is guided by the user's state, it is important to use it in a manner that allows for optimal and functional session management. Updating component (and page) states based on session data has been one of the many challenges plaguing us for some time now. We wanted implement components that updated dynamically each time session state changed without the need of a Localstorage or cookie variable that may be vaunrable to browser-side manipulation. During the course of my research, I discovered that Next.js's router.push function enabled a behaviour that didn't reset our layout. Furthermore, though web-sockets, it was possible to dynamically update a variable that would control state for components on the client side. So, I created a global web-socket context and placed it in layout where all childern in the website would be able to access it. Then using the functions I defined, I can update the state of a variable which is used by components to manage their state.

## Further Explanations of Design Choices

**Secondary WebSocket Server and Context**:
Currently, we already have a websocket server initialized and running to facilitate live chat's. Initially, I was using this server to implement and create the context. However, since this websocket instance is used to load and notify all users of chat changes, it would have of overhead when the server were used for other non-chat operations. Thus, to optimize performance, the decision was made to create separate WebSocket servers for chat and non-chat operations.

The second websocket server is linked to a single websocket context. This context is declared in the layout and can be accessed from any page or component in the website. This allows any page or component to use WebSocket functionality without having to initialize their own context - Saving on resources and other potential conflicts.

**Logging System: Design Choices**
The decision to implement a Logging System was one taken recently as I implemented the purification script. Currently, to observe data flow and changes in our app, we utilize `console.log` place strategically to find potential errors in the app. Once the new feature is working as intended, these `console.log`'s are removed and the code is cleaned. This strategy has worked well for us thus far. However, it consumes a lot of time and effort. Due to this, the decision was made to research and implement a logging system that strategically logs data changes and app functionality allows us to focus in on the specific parts of the app that are not working and use console.logs for more precise debugging.

After conducting some research, I found that two of the most popular loggers used include Winston and Pino. However, after further research, the decision was made to use Pino. While both offer similar feature sets, the difference lays in performance. Adding a logging system can severly slow down a system. Pino is by-far the most optimized logger compared to Winston which can be resouce intensive. In the coming week(s), I will endevour to implement Pino in select parts of the app to develop a robust logging system before implementing it in the remainder of the website.
