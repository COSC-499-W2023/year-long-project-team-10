Orginally I thought I completed both front-end and back-end functionality for the occupation tags
but I realize that the back-end logic is more complex and need a bit more time and get team input and 
advise.

## Active Tasks

- Finish Edit Page

  - Implment and use a file system to help store images and reduce workload for the database
  - Or, wait until we have AWS and S3 and use S3 to help store images
    - I think waiting to have S3 running for videos and images would be better but I will first discuss with the team
- Exploring idea to add loading screen
  - Deciding if its worth implmenting
    - can be good to have in regards to user experience. (if loading is taking a while for the user than it's a good idea to show that the site is loading instead of the user staring at a blank screen)
    - I will get the rest of the teams input
