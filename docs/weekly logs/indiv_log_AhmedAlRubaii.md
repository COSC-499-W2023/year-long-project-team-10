- As it was the reading break, minimal work was done. I continued the start of my research for different AWS services that may be useful for our project by reading documentation and watched youtube tutorials explaining how some of them work. 

## Active Tasks

- Research AWS services that may be of use for the project
- Services found that can be of use:
	- AWS EC2
 	- AWS RDS
	- AWS S3

-----------------

**Week**: 12

**Work Period**: 20 November 2023 - 26 November 2023

## Individual Objectives

- For this week, I have conducted even more research into the various AWS services available that can be of use. Below are the listed services that may be of use. I have also attempted to statically host our website on AWS for the second milestone, and if possible and all goes well, to then dynamically host it as well. Currently, www.somethingsomethingcompany.com is up and running and being hosted from S3 buckets with Route 53 providing the DNS. I have run into a problem in that the page routes are not working when uploading a deployable version of our app. The source of this issue is attributed to how Next.JS produces a build version and to how AWS handles page routing. Also, as can be seen from the website, it is an older version of our app where they UI is not updated but that is not a concern as it can be easily updated by swapping the S3 bucket contents. Details on why these services were chosen will be included within the design document and the opened issue on github regarding AWS deployment. We also discussed how we would like to have our data encrypted within our project as a team.

## Active Tasks

- Continued research onto AWS services to be used for our project:
	- AWS EC2
	- AWS ECS
	- AWS ECR
	- AWS RDS
	- AWS S3

### Additional Notes
As discussed with the TA, I will be providing some additional notes regarding my work this week as proof as I have not contributed to the project in terms of coding but mainly in terms of AWS deployment. After researching, reading documentation and watching tutorials, I have chosen a few AWS services that can be used for our project. As we have a 3 tier client-server architecture, the use of AWS ECS would work very well. ECS allows for us to upload multiple docker containers (one for each of our nextjs, express js and database) within ECR and to initialize them to be run on separate EC2 instances. These EC2 instances are able to communicate with each other and should be able to share data as they currently do on localhost. we are also planning on using amazon's database service RDS as it has support for postgressql. To store all of our files, we can use AWS S3 and keep them in buckets. buckets can also add a layer of security depending on the configuration. We will also be looking into using AWS cloudfront to reduce latency and load times of the app. AWS route 53 will be used for DNS and any related tasks. Currently working on getting static hosting of the app to work. I have also read the Amazon documentation regarding S3 and ECS and have watched tutorials regarding all the previously mentioned AWS services that were found to be useful. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mls8tiiI3uc , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Ys0LnMSnY , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNSItBN15w , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-RtA6FlbgQ , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfU0JEZjcsg) these for reference are a few of the tutorials I have watched and have been following. As stated previously, www.somethingsomethingcompany.com is up and running (although routing not working fully) which shows that I have been working on the project, although not in a coding sense.

**Week**: 13

**Work Period**: 27 November 2023 - 3 December 2023

## Individual Objectives

- This week I continued work on deploying the website staticaly onto AWS. I have fixed the issue I was facing with navigation from last week. I have now updated the website so that it has the updated styling and pages (although not all pages are accessible as they need backend functionality to be reached. eg: creatProfile.html). I also worked with my team on the design document and was in charge of doing the database design changes along with creating the ER diagrams. I also recorded a part of this change for the design video. 

## Active Tasks

- Refactor up-to-date code to get an AWS compatable deployable version
- Statically host our app on AWS
- Worked on design submission
	- Wrote the database design changes

**Week**: 14

**Work Period**: 8 January 2024 - 14 January 2024

## Individual Objectives

- This week I conducted research, reading documentation and watching tutorials regarding how we can deploy our app and the different ways of deployment. Using the pointers given to me during the AWS discussion on Tuesday, I research EC2 and Fargate AWS services to be used with ECS. From research done, EC2 gives us more control over the virtual machines which the app is deployed on wheras Fargate leaves all the details to AWS to handle. From this, I think that Fargate will be a better option moving forward. I have as a result just started reading up on how this would work physically with the code we have now as it would require changes and additions to the docker file and other related docker container issues as that is how AWS will interprate them. 

## Active Tasks

- Research AWS services to be used for app deployment
	- Fargate
	- EC2
	- ECS
	- Load balancer
 - Start researching how to dockerize our app to be deployed with AWS standard

**Week**: 16

**Work Period**: 22 January 2024 - 28 January 2024

## Individual Objectives

At the start of the week after some testing was done regarding the new dockerized system that I built, some issues were found. Shaheer helped in finding a solution to those issues specifically regarding web sockets. Next I had an issue regarding uploading the docker images to ECR due to a aws cli configuration and access misunderstanding. After a lot of research and eventually help from Seth on discord, I was able to successfuly gain access to the aes cli and use the commands.

![aws issue](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-10/assets/77289951/c416f816-6337-4b26-ba00-78377cd15c9c)

However there was another issue regarding building the images. for docker to sucessfuly build an image outside using the docker-compose file (as in explicitly building an image using the docker build command) the dockerfile that the image will be built from needs to be explicitly called `Dockerfile`, and because I have named them .nextjs and .express for next and express respectivley they were not building, and this issue to quite a while to understand and diagnose as i found that there were very few cases online where people added suffixes to the dockerfile.

![docker build issue](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-10/assets/77289951/da245088-6770-47ed-81d2-58cf106dd3da)

I eventually found a solution to that which was to create a dockerfile directory which would hold the dockerfiles in a manner where they are explicitly called `Dockerfile`. This was a minor setback as it took a long time to diagnose but the solution was simple and does not have any effect on the overall project. but for safety's sake and because our current docker-compose file works, this directory managment would only be done when pushing a new production version to aws. although the work would be repetitive in fixing the file system, it is a change that takes only 5-10 mins which i am fine with per deployment. After sucessfully uploading the images to ecr, the next issue encountered was using ecs and configuring the tasks. first i had to create a cluster but there was an issue in regards to creating it which was eventually resolved after I had come to it after a while.

![image](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-10/assets/77289951/f4b75bf0-e9d7-4dec-8c2f-a31c1673e943)

after that issue was resolved i continued the deployment process by following tutorials and reading documentation to undertsand the process and the concepts being used. eventually after a first deployment attempt, i ended up getting a `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable` error when trying to access our app. this issue seems to be regarding using the provisioned aws vpc and not having it configured correctly, but i am unsure as there can be many other factors that can cause this issue. furthermore, there was also another realisation that i would require to set up volumes for the containers within ecs which was not mentioned in any of the tutorials i have followed. this took a lot of research in understanding what exactly volumes are and how they work and how containers interact with them. also the way in which aes ecs volumes are established are much different and more confusing that within docker-compose file. I eventually stumbled onto a forum site (i cant find the source now) that mentioned that building the images with the docker build command bundles all the runtime environments and modules within the images itself. this was the concern as we have `.next` and `node_modules` as volumes necessary for nextjs to run in our docker-compose and setting it up within ecs did not seem to line up. however after knowing that, i continued forward without setting volumes in ecs, following with the concept that volumes are bundled within the image when they are built. I am now continuing the deployment process and will be documenting any other issues that i encounter.

**Week**: 17

**Work Period**: 29 January 2024 - 4 February 2024

## Individual Objectives

At the start of this week Shaheer was working on video uploading to the database within our app but found out that our database is unbale to facilitate the storage of video files. From this he approached me saying that the only optimal solution to our video storage problem is to store the videos within AWS S3 buckets. Due to the importance of this feature to our project, i decided to put deployment to the side and focus on this. I had to research and understand S3 and how it would be integrated within our app. I also had to refamiliarize myself with our app is has been a while since i have coded a full feature as my focus has been AWS for a while now. I ended up coding our server endpoint, the API and the client front end. As of now, the feature works on that one page i have created but our objective is to get this feature integrated within our chats page (similar to the upload video button in whatsapp chat). Although it is working as intended there is one small issue which is the credentials needed to connect our app to the S3 bucket. right now i am using my own account's personal access and secret keys which i input into our `.env` file and that facilitates the connection. the problem is that these account access keys are rotated every 15-20 mins and cannot be placed and forgotten about in the code (as in everytime someone wants to use the app they need to enter the new keys). The only solutions i have found to fix this is the creation of IAM users and give them S3 access which would produce static/unchanging keys but the AWS accounts provisioned to us by the client dont have the permissions to create IAM users. I have asked around in class and the discord and am very puzzled as to how this problem can be solved. my target is to get this issue solved by next week and get it out the way because everything else regarding the upload works (to my current knowledge). below is a picture of the first file successfuly uploaded from within our app to S3 bucket

![s3](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-10/assets/77289951/9f8f6b2d-59fc-4dd2-8df8-d6e843f250fb)


There was also an unexpected and weird issue that was encountered regarding docker once again. The app (both frontend with next and backend with express) would not reload/rerender on saving a change within the code which is what normally happens. Running the app as we have previously made it work as intended which was puzzling. I updated, restared and deleted all images and volumes associated along with my computer but to no avail. Yafei mentioned he is encountering the same issue but what is confusing is that Shaheer and Satanshu say that it works perfectly for them, as if they were running it manualy. This issue took some research to be done into it but to no avail regarding finding a solution for it (i think it may be an OS thing since yafei and i use windows while satanshu and shaheer use mac)

**Week**: 18

**Work Period**: 5 February 2024 - 11 February 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week was mostly spent on troubleshooting and trying to understand various error/ failure points within the project, specificaly what I have been working on. The first point of concern was getting the rotating credentials issue sorted which has taken a while to get an appropriate response. Due to not getting anything useful from the internet or from the discord group, I emailed the client in which he provided advice on searching and using presigned URL for putting and retrieving items from an S3 bucket rather than having hard-coded credentials. This took some time to research in order to understand what presigned URLs are, how they work and how they can be implemented. During this time, Seth from group 3 (i think) replied to me in discord advicing the use of adjusting the task role and task execution role within fargate during deployment which would provide that fargate instance with an associated IAM role as if it was hard coded by myelf. From his response I again also had to research, understand and know how this would apply to our project. So far from the research I have done, it seems that Seth's solution is more viable and applicable. This means that I will need to adjust the code within our server to accomodate this 'within AWS' call to S3, but will also require me to work on deployment once again as it is all related to getting the app hosted on AWS. My goal is now to attempt deployment once again to fargate, taking into account the different factors and variables that need to be taken into account to make sure that our app is able to make AWS API calls to S3. I have also explained and provided assistance to Arsh in getting him up to speed on some AWS aspects as he will also be working on AWS using other services.

**Week**: 19

**Work Period**: 12 February 2024 - 18 February 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week i have restarted work on the deployment process. However all the work i have done previously seems to have been invalidated/ not working as it should be so i have had to reinitialize all the AWS components that i have previously worked on. New errors have also arisen regarding the deployment process, specificaly network, VPC, subnent and load balancer issues which i have spent some time researching in order to find a solution for properly. most have been solved but there are a few that need some more understanding of the aws fargate deployment architecture to know how to solve properly. the target by the end of reading break is to have deployment complete, even if there are issues with connectivity and app functionality, since i have midterms after reading break and that may be all i can work on. furthermore, the rest of the features for our project are almost complete so the rest of the team will also hopefuly be transitioning to aws work soon to take some load off regarding deployment and get it done faster and in a more complete manner. 

## Active Tasks

- App deployment to ECS with Fargate
- Research VPC and its purpose
- Troubleshoot Load Balance error
- Troubleshoot ECR issue
- Troubleshoot target group issue
    
## Status of Tasks

- App deployment to ECS with Fargate - In Progress
- Research VPC and its purpose - Complete
- Troubleshoot Load Balance error - Complete
- Troubleshoot ECR issue - Complete

## Individual Objectives

This includes both the reading break and the current week. in the reading break i worked on finalizing all the neccessary conditions to set up the deployment environment. i encountered a lot of network errors which i eventually resolved and was able to successfuly deploy a version of our app on AWS: http://499-new-lb-420614602.ca-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com/home. As of writing, it does not work as i have mistakingly uploaded an image of our server which had a very simple error so the server is not running and almost all functionality is not present. although the error is resolved locally, i have withheld the fixed version from being deployed based on the fact that this week we have gotten a lot of progress doen, so i dont want to build and deploy a version that will be expired in a day or two. either on monday or tuesday when we have gotten the features we are currently working on finished, i will make sure to deploy the most up to date version. this hesitation also stems from the fact that we dont have a steady delivery path to AWS and it entails me having to do docker builds and a manual deployment each time. we can look at getting this process streamlined at a future date but it is not our priority at the moment. 

This week I worked closley with Shaheer to bring him up to speed with all things AWS especially S3 and how it works and how we intend to use it. I aided him in getting the S3 upload in which he then integrated that into the chats page. I then further coded the server code needed to retrieve files from S3 and have provided it for him so that he can integrate that too. I have also assisted Arsh in his research and deployment of the AWS Lambda function which uses Rekognition to blur our videos. currently both he and i and facing some difficulity in getting the code to run which we should be able to solve by the end of next week. this would then unlock our ability to blurr videos and bring us very close to the completion of the app.

**Week**: 22

**Work Period**: 4 March 2024 - 10 March 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week i helped in the presentation aspect of our application. i helped in finding any errors and making sure that application was running prior to the peer testing session. i was also involved with troubleshooting an issue with the requests recieved and sent page which then shaheer got to fixing after we discovered what was causing the issue. i have then done some research into lambda and rekognition in order to assist arsh with setting up the video blurring aspect of the app. lastly i have redeployed the latest version of the app to aws. 

## Active Tasks

- App deployment to ECS with Fargate
- Troubleshoot request page issue
- Research and understand lambda and rekognition

    
## Status of Tasks

- App deployment to ECS with Fargate -- Completed

**Week**: 23

**Work Period**: 11 March 2024 - 17 March 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week was mostly spent on getting the blurring feature implemented and deployed. i encountered quite a few errors and issues with the configuration of the demo repository that had the rekognition blurring functionality. after fixing the runtime configuration, i had to fix the errors that were occuring on the aws side while deploying the services. eventually i was able to launch all the associated services. now a video uploaded to a bucket will be processed by aws rekogntion to blur any faces in the video. unfortunatly i was unable to fully integrate this within the app and test it out to make sure all is in working order (right now i was able to test it through the aws console). the target for next week is to integrate this within the app and make sure all runs smoothly. 

## Active Tasks

- Troubleshoot blur repo deployment
- Deploy blur repo
- Integrate functions within our app
- Manual testing of the deployed app

    
## Status of Tasks

**Week**: 24

**Work Period**: 18 March 2024 - 24 March 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week i worked on testing out the new buckets and implementing them within the chats page. i initially had some issues with sending and getting from the newly created buckets that are connected with the lambdas and rekognition blurring functions but they were eventually solved. next i had to find a way to isolate the file type from the signed url that is provided from aws in order to properly view the file depending on if it is a video or a photo. shaheer then took over from this point by integrating this logic within the chats page. further, there has been some testing on the fargate deployment but unfortunatley due to a surprise midterm (was announced on tuesday for friday) i did not get as much done as i had hoped. 

## Active Tasks

- Integrate functions within our app
- Manual testing of the deployed app

**Week**: 25

**Work Period**: 25 March 2024 - 31 March 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week has mainly been spent on fixing and working on the deployment side of the project. I had spent a lot of time in making sure that the containers are able to communicate with each other, similar to how they are able to do so locally through docker. This took a lot of time and effort to finally find a solution on how it is done and is still in progress as I am now working on getting the database container to work as well with its required volumes. Unfortunalty also due to the manner in which how deployment works, any update to the code takes some time until it is reflected on the deployed version which is also a partial reason as to why this has been taking a long time as well. The focus right now and for this final upcoming week is to try my hardest to make sure that the database container is running effectivley and is able to communicate with the other containers, and once all the AWS network configuration and set up has been complete, to deploy the final and most up to date version of the app, along with the completion of the report and associated documents. 


## Active Tasks

- Fixing container communications within Fargate task
- Testing of the app in Fargate
    
## Status of Tasks

- Fixing container communications within Fargate task -- In Progress

**Week**: 26

**Work Period**: 1 April 2024 - 7 April 2024

## Individual Objectives

This week was about the final delivery of the project. I was able to complete my objectives from last week and was able to get a stable working deployment running and all was configured well and have tested to make sure it is working. The following days of the week was spent working on report objectives such as working on the DFD diagram as well as coming up with and finalizing our feature list. As i was in charge of deployment, i had the last step in regards to the finalization of the project. once all development was complete and merged into our development branch, i refactored the code such that it works with the development environment and deployed it. unfortunatley however there was a lot of issues with the current version, mainly stemming from a package that was installed with a new feature (toasts) and the use of environment variables from the `.env` file not registering in the deployment environment. due to that and the lack of time remaining until the due date, i advised the team to do their demo videos on local version out of caution that i may not be able to troubleshoot and fix these issues in time. a few minutes before the deadline i was finally able to fix the deployed version, and it is now currently running and hosted on [this link](http://499-new-lb-420614602.ca-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
