**Week**: 10

**Work Period**: 6 November 2023 - 12 November 2023

## Individual Objectives

- I was involved involved a little bit in re-designing the navbar in order to make it appear more modern. I was also involved in redesigning our search results/dashboard page and what we plan to have it do in terms of functionality. I have also been exploring how to use our Express JS server for the backend by researching and using team-mates' code as a reference. I have started to make an attempt on using Express JS on a local repo as practice for now. I have also started to do some research into the different AWS services that are available to us as we plan to host our project on AWS soon.

**Week**: 11 (Reading Break)

**Work Period**: 13 November 2023 - 19 November 2023

## Individual Objectives

- As it was the reading break, minimal work was done. I continued the start of my research for different AWS services that may be useful for our project by reading documentation and watched youtube tutorials explaining how some of them work. 

## Active Tasks

- Research AWS services that may be of use for the project
- Services found that can be of use:
	- AWS EC2
 	- AWS RDS
	- AWS S3   
## Status of Tasks

- Research AWS services that may be of use for the project -- In Progress

-----------------

**Week**: 12

**Work Period**: 20 November 2023 - 26 November 2023

## Individual Objectives

- For this week, I have conducted even more research into the various AWS services available that can be of use. Below are the listed services that may be of use. I have also attempted to statically host our website on AWS for the second milestone, and if possible and all goes well, to then dynamically host it as well. Currently, www.somethingsomethingcompany.com is up and running and being hosted from S3 buckets with Route 53 providing the DNS. I have run into a problem in that the page routes are not working when uploading a deployable version of our app. The source of this issue is attributed to how Next.JS produces a build version and to how AWS handles page routing. Also, as can be seen from the website, it is an older version of our app where they UI is not updated but that is not a concern as it can be easily updated by swapping the S3 bucket contents. Details on why these services were chosen will be included within the design document and the opened issue on github regarding AWS deployment. We also discussed how we would like to have our data encrypted within our project as a team.

## Active Tasks

- Continued research onto AWS services to be used for our project:
	- AWS EC2
	- AWS ECS
	- AWS ECR
	- AWS RDS
	- AWS S3
	- AWS Route 35
	- AWS Cloudfront
	- AWS Cognito -- Tentative
	- AWS Rekognition -- Tentative
	- AWS Amplify -- Tentative
	- AWS Lambda -- Tentative
 - Worked on statically hosting our app on AWS
 - Started working on design document and milestone 2 design submission
 - Discussed and decided on encryption methods to be used

### Additional Notes
As discussed with the TA, I will be providing some additional notes regarding my work this week as proof as I have not contributed to the project in terms of coding but mainly in terms of AWS deployment. After researching, reading documentation and watching tutorials, I have chosen a few AWS services that can be used for our project. As we have a 3 tier client-server architecture, the use of AWS ECS would work very well. ECS allows for us to upload multiple docker containers (one for each of our nextjs, express js and database) within ECR and to initialize them to be run on separate EC2 instances. These EC2 instances are able to communicate with each other and should be able to share data as they currently do on localhost. we are also planning on using amazon's database service RDS as it has support for postgressql. To store all of our files, we can use AWS S3 and keep them in buckets. buckets can also add a layer of security depending on the configuration. We will also be looking into using AWS cloudfront to reduce latency and load times of the app. AWS route 53 will be used for DNS and any related tasks. Currently working on getting static hosting of the app to work. I have also read the Amazon documentation regarding S3 and ECS and have watched tutorials regarding all the previously mentioned AWS services that were found to be useful. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mls8tiiI3uc , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Ys0LnMSnY , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNSItBN15w , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-RtA6FlbgQ , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfU0JEZjcsg) these for reference are a few of the tutorials I have watched and have been following. As stated previously, www.somethingsomethingcompany.com is up and running (although routing not working fully) which shows that I have been working on the project, although not in a coding sense.

**Week**: 13

**Work Period**: 27 November 2023 - 3 December 2023

## Individual Objectives

- This week I continued work on deploying the website staticaly onto AWS. I have fixed the issue I was facing with navigation from last week. I have now updated the website so that it has the updated styling and pages (although not all pages are accessible as they need backend functionality to be reached. eg: creatProfile.html). I also worked with my team on the design document and was in charge of doing the database design changes along with creating the ER diagrams. I also recorded a part of this change for the design video. 

## Active Tasks

- Refactor up-to-date code to get an AWS compatable deployable version
- Statically host our app on AWS
- Worked on design submission
	- Wrote the database design changes
	- Did ER diagrams
	- Did video part for submission

---------------------------

**Week**: 14

**Work Period**: 8 January 2024 - 14 January 2024

## Individual Objectives

- This week I conducted research, reading documentation and watching tutorials regarding how we can deploy our app and the different ways of deployment. Using the pointers given to me during the AWS discussion on Tuesday, I research EC2 and Fargate AWS services to be used with ECS. From research done, EC2 gives us more control over the virtual machines which the app is deployed on wheras Fargate leaves all the details to AWS to handle. From this, I think that Fargate will be a better option moving forward. I have as a result just started reading up on how this would work physically with the code we have now as it would require changes and additions to the docker file and other related docker container issues as that is how AWS will interprate them. 

## Active Tasks

- Research AWS services to be used for app deployment
	- Fargate
	- EC2
	- ECS
	- Load balancer
 - Start researching how to dockerize our app to be deployed with AWS standard

**Week**: 15

**Work Period**: 15 January 2024 - 21 January 2024

## Individual Objectives

- Worked on the dockerization of the application. Created `Dockerfiles` for any required service and updated the `docker-compose.yml` to work accordingly. Had to research and understand the concpets of how docker works and the datails of writitng and updating a docker files in preparation for deployment. Also had some difficulty regarding the ports and the environment variables which were solved. Then started work on first steps of deployment to AWS ECS with Fargate.

## Active Tasks
